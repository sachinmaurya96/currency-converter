## What I Learned

Throughout the development of this Currency Converter project, I gained valuable insights and hands-on experience in the following key areas:

### React Hooks

Implemented and leveraged various React Hooks to manage state, side effects, and lifecycle events efficiently. This includes useState, useEffect, useContext, and custom hooks for enhanced functionality.

### Handling Big Projects

Navigated the complexities of larger-scale projects, learning how to organize code, manage components, and maintain a clear project structure for better scalability and maintainability.

### Custom Hooks

Created custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse logic across different parts of the application, promoting code modularity and reducing redundancy.

### Reusable Components

Designed and implemented reusable React components, allowing for a more modular and maintainable codebase. This approach enhances code efficiency and facilitates future development and updates.

### Handling API

Integrated external APIs, specifically a currency API, to fetch real-time exchange rates. This experience involved making asynchronous requests, handling responses, and updating the UI accordingly.

### Conditional Rendering

Implemented conditional rendering techniques to dynamically display content based on different scenarios, providing a more interactive and responsive user interface.

### Basic Functionalities

Developed and refined fundamental features of a currency converter, such as input validation, currency selection, and real-time conversion. This allowed for a comprehensive understanding of building user-friendly applications.

These learnings collectively contribute to a solid foundation in React development and serve as a valuable experience in building practical, real-world applications.
